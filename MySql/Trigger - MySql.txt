ChatGPT
To create a SQL trigger that fetches family and address details from two different tables, "family" and "address_details," using the main contact number from the "personal_details" table whenever the contact number is updated, you can use the following SQL Server trigger as an example. You'll need to modify it according to your database system and table structures:


-- Create an AFTER UPDATE trigger

CREATE TRIGGER Trigger_UpdateFamilyAndAddressDetails
ON personal_details
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    IF UPDATE(main_contact_number)
    BEGIN
        DECLARE @UpdatedMainContactNumber INT;

        -- Get the updated main contact number from the INSERTED pseudo-table
        SELECT @UpdatedMainContactNumber = main_contact_number
        FROM INSERTED;

        -- Fetch family and address details for the updated main contact number
        SELECT
            pd.main_contact_number,
            f.family_columns,
            ad.address_columns
        FROM personal_details pd
        LEFT JOIN family f ON pd.main_contact_number = f.main_contact_number
        LEFT JOIN address_details ad ON pd.main_contact_number = ad.main_contact_number
        WHERE pd.main_contact_number = @UpdatedMainContactNumber;
    END;
END;
