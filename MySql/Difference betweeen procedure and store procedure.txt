Difference betweeen procedure and store procedure

The terms "procedure" and "stored procedure" are often used interchangeably, but there can be a subtle difference in how they are used in different contexts. Let's clarify the distinctions:

Procedure:

In a general sense, a "procedure" typically refers to a set of instructions or a sequence of actions that perform a specific task or function in a program or script.
A "procedure" can be a generic term and might not refer specifically to a database concept.
Procedures can exist in various programming languages and are not limited to databases. They can be used in applications, scripts, and more.
Stored Procedure:

A "stored procedure" is a specific database concept that is used within a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, or PostgreSQL.
A "stored procedure" is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements and other procedural code that is stored and executed on the database server.
Stored procedures are typically used to encapsulate a series of SQL statements into a reusable and efficient unit that can be called from within applications or scripts.
Stored procedures are often used for tasks such as data retrieval, data modification, or business logic within the database.
In summary, the key difference is that a "procedure" is a broader term that can refer to any sequence of actions in a program or script, while a "stored procedure" specifically refers to a database concept used to encapsulate and execute SQL and procedural code within a DBMS. When people commonly refer to "procedures" in the context of databases, they often mean "stored procedures."
