    event_date TIMESTAMP

    ('2022-01-15 12:30:00'),

Working with dates in Amazon Redshift involves various operations such as extracting components, formatting, arithmetic, and handling time zones.  

Practice exercises: 

1. Date Arithmetic: 

Perform date arithmetic to calculate the difference between two dates and add or subtract days from a given date.   

-- Calculate the age of each user based on their birthdate 

SELECT user_id, birthdate, 

       DATEDIFF('year', birthdate, GETDATE()) AS age 

FROM user_table; 

  

-- Add 7 days to the order date  

  

SELECT order_id, order_date, 

       order_date + INTERVAL '7 days' AS new_delivery_date 

FROM orders; 

  

2. Extracting Date Components:  

Use functions to extract specific components (day, month, year, etc.) from date values.   

-- Extract the day of the week and month from the order date 

  

SELECT order_id, order_date, 

       EXTRACT(DOW FROM order_date) AS day_of_week, 

       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month 

FROM orders; 

  

 

 

 

 

3. Date Formatting: 

 Format dates according to a specific format using the TO_CHAR function. 

  

-- Format the order date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format 

  

SELECT order_id, TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS formatted_order_date 

FROM orders; 

  

4. Filtering by Date Range:  

Filter data based on a specific date range.   

   

-- Retrieve orders placed in the last 30 days 

  

SELECT order_id, order_date 

FROM orders 

WHERE order_date >= GETDATE() - INTERVAL '30 days'; 

  

5. Time Zone Conversion:  

Convert dates between different time zones.   

   

-- Convert order dates from UTC to 'America/New_York' time zone 

  

SELECT order_id, order_date, 

       CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'America/New_York', order_date) AS est_order_date 

FROM orders; 

  

 

 

 

 

6. Handling NULL Dates:  

Handle NULL dates gracefully in your queries.  

   

-- Display 'N/A' for NULL birthdates 

  

SELECT user_id, COALESCE(TO_CHAR(birthdate, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'N/A') AS formatted_birthdate 

FROM user_table; 

  

7. Identify Weekdays and Weekends:  

Determine whether a date falls on a weekday or weekend.  

   

-- Classify orders as 'Weekday' or 'Weekend' 

  

SELECT order_id, order_date, 

       CASE WHEN EXTRACT(DOW FROM order_date) IN (0, 6) THEN 'Weekend' ELSE 'Weekday' END AS day_type 

FROM orders; 

 

 

Current date in redshift: 

  

SELECT GETDATE() AS current_date;  

  

DATE_TRUNC function: 

  

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', GETDATE()) AS current_date; 

  

This will truncate the time part, providing only the current date. Adjust the format and functions as needed based on your specific requirements. 

 

-- CORRECT DATE FORMAT.... 

  

SELECT CURRENT_DATE AS current_date;   

SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS current_date; 

SELECT current_time AS currenttime;  

  

-- SELECT TO_CHAR(GETDATE(), 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS current_time_with_seconds;   -- THIS IS NOT WORKING
