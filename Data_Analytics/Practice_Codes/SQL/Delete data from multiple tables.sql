Delete data from multiple tables using inner join:  

No, the standard SQL DELETE syntax does not directly support deleting data from multiple tables using an INNER JOIN. The DELETE statement is designed to remove rows from a single table based on a condition specified in the WHERE clause. 

  

If you need to delete data from multiple tables based on a common condition, you typically need to issue separate DELETE statements for each table. Alternatively, you can use transactions to ensure that the changes are atomic (either all succeed, or all fail). 

  

Here's an example of deleting data from multiple tables with separate DELETE statements: 

  

-- Assuming you have two tables: table1 and table2 

DELETE FROM table1 

WHERE common_column = your_condition; 

  

DELETE FROM table2 

WHERE common_column = your_condition; 

  

  

If you need to ensure that both deletes succeed or fail together, you can use a transaction:  

-- Start a transaction 

BEGIN TRANSACTION; 

  

-- Assuming you have two tables: table1 and table2 

DELETE FROM table1 

WHERE common_column = your_condition; 

  

DELETE FROM table2 

WHERE common_column = your_condition; 

 

  

-- Commit the transaction if everything is successful 

COMMIT; 

  

-- Rollback the transaction if there is an issue

ROLLBACK;
